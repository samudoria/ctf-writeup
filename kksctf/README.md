You will not able to solve this, until you have your skin on. Arnie will confirm it.
Hint: if your flag looks good, but taskboard says "bad flag", try another encoding table. Flag is meaningful and l33t.`

The challenge gave us a picture with some strange characters to find to get the flag.

One teammate pointed out that they were from the "Alien vs. Predator" alphabet where Arnold Schwarzenegger starred but the challenge already gave us a clue by mentioning "Arnie" and "not a terminator". There are a lot of versions online that weren't working and gave us the wrong string until we found this font https://fonts2u.com/predator.font and with lots of patience we got the the flag `kks{Y0uNgArni3IsCoOl}`
